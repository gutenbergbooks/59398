<p>When the Hawaiian Islands were first studied by ornithologists
in the nineteenth century, they were a bird paradise. The forests
abounded with many of the most unusual birds known to the world&mdash;some
with enormous sickle-shaped bills, some resembling parrots, a
goose that spent most of its life on barren lava flows, a tiny flightless
rail, and a sea bird that nested within the vents of the active volcanoes.
Most of these island birds were found nowhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Today many of the original island species are extinct, while
others are barely managing to hold their own. With more and more
land being cleared for agriculture and homesites, virgin forests
here are becoming scarce. Thus, protected areas like Hawaii Volcanoes
and Haleakala National Parks take on great significance as
reserves where the native birds will continue to survive. If you wish
to learn about Hawaiian birdlife, you will certainly want to spend
some time in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and visit Haleakala
National Park on the island of Maui. This booklet is meant to be an
aid to your trips in the field.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">HOW THE BIRDS CAME</span></h2>
<p>Geologically the Hawaiian Islands are considered to be fairly
young, probably no more than 20 million years old. The islands
are also extremely isolated from any other land masses; it is more
than 2,000 miles to the nearest continent. Before any resident birdlife
could exist here, plants had to become established. Seeds arrived
by various means from distant lands, and one by one new kinds of
plants began to grow on the volcanoes&mdash;at first only a few primitive
types could get a foothold on the barren lava, but in time those early
plants decayed and combined with the basalt rock to produce a soil
that could support a complex vegetation.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Endemics</span></h3>
<p>We have no way of knowing what kind of land bird was the first
to take up residence here, for that early species has certainly been
greatly altered through the workings of evolution. In fact today
nearly all the resident native birds are types that are now found
nowhere else in the world. Birds such as these are called <i>endemic</i>;
they have undergone gradual change over the millennia to become
completely new forms, different from any birds found elsewhere.</p>
<p>Many of Hawaii&rsquo;s endemic species belong to the Hawaiian honeycreeper
family (Drepaniidae) and are thought to have evolved from
a single bird prototype that possibly arrived here from Central or
South America. Explosive bursts of evolutionary change followed,
and the resulting new forms did not much resemble each other.
Present day park representatives of the Hawaiian honeycreepers
include the apapane, iiwi, and amakihi.</p>
<p>Besides the Hawaiian honeycreeper stock several other early
migrants made their residence in Hawaii and evolved into endemic
forms. In the park they include a Hawaiian race of the (North
American) short-eared owl, the io (a hawk), the nene (a goose),
the omao (a thrush), and the elepaio (an Old World flycatcher).</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Migrants and Sea Birds</span></h3>
<p>While the endemic species have acquired full residence on the
islands, other birds live here for only part of the year, usually returning
to the north during summer to breed. In the park the best known
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
of these migrants is the American golden plover which spends almost
10 months of the year in Hawaii and only 2 months on its travels
to the Aleutian Islands.</p>
<p>Migration patterns for certain of the sea birds are virtually
unknown. Some, like the white-tailed tropic-bird, may remain near
the islands throughout the year, while others, such as the dark-rumped
petrel, migrate inland only during their breeding season.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Exotics</span></h3>
<p>The most recent additions to Hawaii&rsquo;s avifauna are birds brought
in since 1855 by man. There are various reasons for the introductions;
the mynah, for example, was brought here from India in 1865
to combat the army worm and other insect pests. Perhaps most of the
exotics were introduced because people wanted to see birds that
reminded them of their former homes. Birds like the cardinal from
the eastern United States and the white-eye from Japan are in this
category. For years the Hui Manu, a local bird club, was active
in releasing new birds on the islands. Game birds constitute another
type of introduction. The first to arrive was the California quail more
than a hundred years ago. Pheasants and chukars among others have
also become established in the park from importations.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">THE DECLINE OF NATIVE BIRDS</span></h2>
<p>In no area in the world have native birds fared more poorly
than in Hawaii during the past century. The causes of the decimation
of numbers and species are probably multiple; certainly no single
factor alone can be cited. Possibly some of the most specialized
forms had already begun a decline in numbers before the
arrival of Western man. It is unlikely that feather gathering for
leis as practiced by the ancient Hawaiians had much to do with the
decline. On the other hand, the clearing of land, which began early
in the 1800&rsquo;s, must have had a devastating effect on those birds that
had become so specialized&mdash;they simply were forced into new
environments and were unable to adapt. The introduction of new
plants, especially grasses, and the establishment of feral mammals
(goats, sheep, and pigs), and insects played a subtle but possibly
even more destructive role in altering the over-all environment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Introduction of exotic birds must have been the final blow to
many of the native species. Unfortunately until recently there was
no adequate control over importing and releasing new birds in
Hawaii. The delicate balance of nature was rudely upset when some
of the more aggressive exotic birds were released indiscriminately
on the islands. Exotic birds such as the white-eye became so plentiful
that direct competition for food with the natives must have occurred.
Furthermore, bird diseases new to Hawaii, such as avian malaria
(probably brought to the islands with some introduced bird from
the Orient), would have been a great killer. With a few exceptions,
however, it does seem that the remaining Hawaiian native birds
are now holding their own.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">WHERE TO SEE THE BIRDS</span></h2>
<p>You will probably be amazed at the extremes of climate in Hawaii,
especially on Kilauea Volcano. This is one of the rare places in the
world where you can walk a few hundred yards from an area of
heavy rainfall to one of striking dryness. The change is due to
prevailing trade winds which force moisture laden clouds up over
the mountain masses from the northeast, then allow the clouds to
dissipate on the leeward side of the mountains. By taking the Crater
Rim drive at Kilauea, you will pass through lush fern jungle on one
side of the crater and barren desert on the other.</p>
<p>Birds are very sensitive to these differences in climate. Most of
the species you find at Thurston Lava Tube will never be seen at
Halemaumau, less than 3 miles away. The same thing is true at
Haleakala, although less dramatically so. To help you locate the
most rewarding sites for bird study in the park, here are a few
suggestions:</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Kilauea-Mauna Loa</span></h3>
<p><i>Thurston Lava Tube.</i> This is the heart of Hawaii&rsquo;s tree-fern
jungle and an excellent habitat for several native species, such as
the apapane, iiwi, and amakihi. Spend a few moments looking for
these at the exhibit overlook, then take the quarter-mile loop path
that leads through the lava tube. On the other side of the lava tube
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
parking area a trail descends into Kilauea Iki, the site of the 1959
eruption. This delightful walk also passes through fern jungle. Be
on the lookout for the io (Hawaiian hawk) in Kilauea Iki.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="455" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Grass slopes on the Mauna Loa Strip</i></p>
</div>
<p><i>Halemaumau.</i> A most unlikely place for birds; however, there
are almost always a few white-tailed tropic-birds soaring within
the pit.</p>
<p><i>Kipuka Puaulu.</i> A popular name for this area is &ldquo;Bird Park&rdquo;
and for good reason, for this kipuka, a hundred acre island of well
developed vegetation surrounded by a recent lava flow, harbors
11 or more species. The commonest here are the white-eye, red-billed
leiothrix, and house finch&mdash;all exotics. When the ohia trees
are in bloom, and usually there are at least a few, large numbers of
iiwis and apapanes are attracted to the kipuka. Other interesting
birds often seen here are the elepaio, Japanese blue pheasant, and
cardinal.</p>
<p><i>Mauna Loa Strip.</i> More kinds of birds (18) have been recorded
from the koa parkland along the Mauna Loa Strip road than from
any other locality in the park, but you are not likely to see large
numbers in any one place along the strip. The road ascends the
lower slopes of Mauna Loa from 4,000 feet at Kipuka Puaulu to
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
6,663 feet. Several introduced game birds&mdash;Japanese blue pheasant,
California quail, and chukar&mdash;may be flushed as you drive up the
road. Skylarks and house finches are fairly common along the
grassy flats, and you are almost sure to see an amakihi in the koa
grove at the end of the road. If you are lucky you might be rewarded
with a glimpse of a nene somewhere on these upper slopes.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Haleakala</span></h3>
<p><i>Hosmer Grove and Paliku.</i> These two localities are about the
only densely wooded areas in Haleakala National Park and both
attract a variety of birdlife. The apapane, iiwi, and amakihi as
well as several exotic birds can be seen at either place. A delightful
self-guiding nature trail that identifies many of the plants and trees
winds through the Hosmer Grove.</p>
<p><i>Road to Haleakala Summit.</i> As you drive up to the Observatory
from Park Headquarters you will probably be surprised at the number
of ring-necked pheasants and chukars that flush along the road.
Golden plovers and skylarks are also plentiful, and mockingbirds
may be seen occasionally.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">THE NATIONAL PARKS</span></h2>
<p>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and Haleakala National Park
are two of more than 180 different areas administered by the National
Park Service for your enjoyment. The two areas, Haleakala on Maui
and Kilauea-Mauna Loa on Hawaii, were set aside, as one park, by
Congress in 1916 mainly because of the three great volcanoes. In
July 1961 Haleakala became a separate national park. In recent
years the unique flora and fauna found in the parks have become an
increasingly important part of the park story. Thus you will find
several interesting exhibits at the Kilauea headquarters museum
dealing with the ecology of the park with emphasis on the birdlife.</p>
<p>One of the guiding principles for any national park is that all
native species of plants and animals are rigidly protected. In places
like Hawaii, where so much of the land has been altered through
clearing and planting, the park becomes a particularly important
sanctuary for birds and other animals. Please help do your share
in protecting this area by observing park regulations.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">ABOUT THIS BOOKLET</span></h2>
<p>The purpose of this booklet is to help anyone who cares to learn
about the birdlife of the national parks in Hawaii. Many of you,
here in Hawaii for the first time, will not recognize most of our birds;
however, the species are so few (32 described here) that it will not
be too hard to narrow your identification to the correct one. The
little perching birds are likely to give the most trouble, and the
commonest of these are shown on the <a href="#table1">color plate</a>. You will probably
want to refer to the plate first when identifying a small bird. Descriptions
in the text refer to similar species also, so if you see a bird that
appears somewhat, but not exactly, like one of the illustrations, look
up the illustrated species in the text for clues.</p>
<p>Hawaiian names, when known, are used as the common name
for each bird, except for species that range elsewhere (e.g., all the
sea birds and introduced birds). The <i>A.O.U. Checklist of North
American Birds</i> has been used as the authority of nomenclature
wherever applicable, otherwise the <i>Checklist and Summary of Hawaiian
Birds</i> by E. H. Bryan, Jr., has been followed. For every
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
description, length from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail is
given in inches. The stated distributions are for the park only and
they emphasize accessible places that you are most likely to visit.</p>
<p>The serious bird student will want to have books that include
Hawaiian birds outside the park. The latest edition of Peterson&rsquo;s
<i>A Field Guide to Western Birds</i> includes a section on Hawaii and
will prove invaluable.</p>
<p>In preparing the text for this booklet frequent reference was made
to George C. Munro, 1944, <i>Birds of Hawaii</i> and Hawaii Audubon
Society, 1959, <i>Hawaiian Birds</i>. The most important current references
for the Hawaiian honeycreeper group are Dean Amadon&rsquo;s
(1950) monograph, <i>The Hawaiian Honeycreepers</i> and <i>Annual Cycle</i>,
<i>Environment and Evolution in the Hawaiian Honeycreepers</i> by Paul
H. Baldwin (1953). Baldwin, a former Assistant to the Superintendent
of Hawaii National Park, has authored several other important
papers on birdlife here. <i>The Game Birds in Hawaii</i> by Charles W. and
Elizabeth R. Schwartz is an invaluable reference on gamebirds.</p>
<p>The author wishes to acknowledge helpful suggestions made by

<h3 class="inline" id="c7">DARK-RUMPED PETREL <i>Pterodroma phaeopygia</i>
<br />(Hawaiian name&mdash;uau)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 15&Prime;. Underparts, forehead, and cheeks, white; back, upper
wings, and upper tail, dark. The crown is black.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: This petrel is a sea bird that nests in the mountains
of the Hawaiian group; it is the nesting birds that may be seen or heard
within the park between May and November. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Status unknown;
the cliffs of Kilauea Crater may be used for nesting. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Many birds
nest in the walls of the crater. The cliffs behind Kapalaoa and Holua Cabins
are the best places to hear them at night.</p>
<p>VOICE: As the birds fly overhead seeking their burrows after dusk, the air
is filled with their strange calls, some of which sound like the barking of a
small dog. A common pattern of notes is <i>oooo-w&eacute;h, ooo-w&eacute;h, oo-w&eacute;h, oo-w&eacute;h</i>,
etc., with the first notes drawn out and the last run together in rapid
succession.</p>
<p class="tb">Dark-rumped Petrels spend most of their life at sea, but in April and May
they begin their nightly flights inland to burrows they have established high on
the cliffs of Hawaiian volcanoes. A single egg is laid near the end of the
horizontal cavity that may be more than 6 feet deep in the rocks. For the next
6 months the adults will fly in from the ocean each night to tend the nest, arriving
about an hour after sundown. It is while they are circling in search of the
burrows that you can hear their mysterious barking sounds. The calling may
continue for 2 hours or more. Imagine the problems that each petrel must
face trying to find its own burrow 20 miles from the ocean on a foggy,
moonless night&mdash;perhaps the continuous calling back and forth helps orient
it. The adults return to the ocean before sunrise.</p>
<p>In the early days nesting birds were common on all the main Hawaiian
Islands; however, for a time it was feared that they were becoming extinct.
Hawaiians used to dig out the downy young petrels for food, and introduced
mongooses and cats also took a heavy toll, especially where nests were at
lower elevations. Now, with known breeding colonies high on Haleakala
and Mauna Kea and probably on Mauna Loa and Kilauea, the future of this
interesting species seems assured.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c8">WHITE-TAILED TROPIC-BIRD <i>Pha&euml;thon lepturus</i>
<br />(Hawaiian name&mdash;koae)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 30&Prime;-32&Prime;. Unmistakable as a large white bird with two
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
fantastically long tail plumes, soaring around rocky cliffs such as in Halemaumau.
There is some black on the upper wings and around the face.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Uncommon, except locally. There are
nearly always a few birds soaring in Halemaumau, around the pit craters in
the Kau Desert, and near Hilina Pali. They are occasionally seen along the
coast. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Some can usually be seen in the crater, especially around
the ruggedest cliffs such as behind Holua and Paliku Cabins.</p>
<p>VOICE: High pitched rasping cries.</p>
<p class="tb">Halemaumau&mdash;What a strange place for a sea bird! Yet these fish-eating
birds have nested in the Kilauea area for as long as we have records.
In recent years Halemaumau has been their favorite haunt, except when
volcano fumes drive them away, such as during the time when heavy sulphur
gasses filled the pit in June 1960. When Halemaumau erupts the birds may
become trapped by rapidly rising hot gas; in 1952 several of them perished,
falling into the molten lava below. For a meal the Halemaumau birds must
make at least a 10-mile flight to the ocean.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c9">NENE <i>Branta sandvicensis</i>
<br />(also Hawaiian goose)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 23&Prime;-28&Prime;. The only ducklike bird apt to be seen in the park.
A medium sized goose with striking head and neck markings. The face, crown,
and top of the neck are black, the throat and neck sides are cream colored,
and the remainder of the body is mottled and dark.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Formerly abundant in Hawaii and probably Maui.
Now extinct on Maui, while a few wild birds remain on Hawaii. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Occasionally
seen on the slopes of Mauna Loa usually between 6,000 and
7,500 feet.</p>
<p>VOICE: Various thin, creaky notes. Often gives a high-pitched honking in
flight.</p>
<p class="tb">Because of recent studies, the habits of the nene are probably better
understood than those of any other native Hawaiian bird. The most amazing
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
thing about their life is the way they have forsaken water in favor of rough,
clinkery lava. All other ducks and geese rear their young partly in water, but
today the breeding grounds for the nene, high on the barren slopes of Mauna
Loa, are far from the nearest open water. Here during the winter months the
geese raise their broods of two to five young. Berries, herbs, and grass growing
in kipukas (islands of vegetation surrounded by more recent lava flows) comprise
the diet. At present the nene is one of the rarest birds in the world and
has been near extinction in recent years.</p>
<p>The story of the nene&rsquo;s decline is a sad one but it may yet have a happy
ending. Early visitors to the islands described the large flocks of nene geese
in the interior of Hawaii, but by 1900 a great decline in numbers had occurred
and in 1940 the entire population was estimated at 30 to 50 wild birds. Clearing
of the land, introduction of such exotic mammals as rats, pigs, dogs, and
mongooses, and man himself through hunting&mdash;all must share the blame for
the nene decimation. Happily, the State of Hawaii has taken vigorous recognition
of this situation and a restoration program was begun in 1949. The
plan is to study the remaining wild birds to learn how the decimating factors
may be controlled. Also nene raised in captivity have been released on Mauna
Loa to intermix with the wild flocks, and it is hoped that some day visitors
to Hawaii will again be assured of seeing these wonderful geese.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="c10">IO <i>Buteo solitarius</i>
<br />(also Hawaiian hawk)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 16&Prime;-18&Prime;. The only hawklike bird to be seen on the islands,
except for accidental migrants. This small <i>Buteo</i> has both light and dark color
phases. Can be distinguished from the Pueo, Hawaii&rsquo;s diurnal owl, by a
smaller head and more soaring flight.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Found only on the island of Hawaii. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Occasional
throughout the park. Individuals are often seen soaring around the
forested craters such as Kilauea Iki and Makaopuhi, or in the more open
areas such as along the Mauna Loa Strip road.</p>
<p>VOICE: A medium-pitched, but fairly soft, scream.</p>
<p class="tb">The io is certainly one of the rarest hawks in the world, as its range is
limited to the island of Hawaii, and even here it is not common. It feeds on
rats, mice, and large insects and spiders, and occasionally will catch birds,
but today birds comprise a minor part of the diet. It tends to be tamer than
mainland hawks, perhaps because it has not been harassed as much in recent
years, and sometimes you can approach a perched io quite closely. Because
of its rodent diet, the io is a very beneficial bird to Hawaii.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>California quail (male and female)</i></p>
</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c11">CALIFORNIA QUAIL <i>Lophortyx californicus</i></h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 9&frac12;&Prime;-10&frac12;&Prime;. The distinctive <i>curved head plume</i> identifies
this plump quail. Males have a black and white face pattern beneath the
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
brown crown, while females are duller and lack the striking facial pattern.
The bill is short and black.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced from California before 1855 to all
major islands. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Moderately common along the Mauna Loa Strip
and south and west of Kilauea Crater, for example Kipuka Nene. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Fairly
common on slopes outside the crater up to about 8,000 feet.</p>
<p>VOICE: Both sexes issue a three noted <i>ka-k&eacute;r-ko</i>, also clucking notes <i>tek-tek</i>,
etc.</p>
<p class="tb">Although the California quail has been in the islands for a long time, it has
not spread much in the park, probably because there is no available open
water. In this situation the birds must rely on dewfall, berries, or succulent
vegetation for their moisture requirements. They shun heavy forests and do
best where small grassy openings are interspersed with dense brush thickets.</p>
<h3>CHUKAR <i>Alectoris graeca</i></h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 15&Prime;. A heavy ground dwelling partridge, brownish with
buffy, black, and rusty markings. A black band extends through each eye and
joins the lower throat. Distinguished from the quail by lighter color, lack
of a head plume, and a red-orange bill.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="257" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Chukar</i></p>
</div>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced on Hawaii in 1949, on Maui in 1953.
<b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Occasional on the slopes of Mauna Loa, descending as far as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
rim of Kilauea Crater. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Common in open lava slopes inside and
out of the crater but especially along the drive to the summit.</p>
<p>VOICE: Chickenlike cackles and clucks, sometimes quite loud.</p>
<p class="tb">They are well camouflaged to blend with Hawaii&rsquo;s gray lava and are not
usually seen until one or more flushes from an open or even bare slope. Then
they will fly downslope, sometimes for hundreds of yards, land, and again
merge invisibly with the somber background.</p>
<p>During the breeding season in late spring and summer the birds pair up;
at other times of the year you may encounter coveys of a dozen or more.</p>
<h3>RING-NECKED PHEASANT <i>Phasianus colchicus torquatus</i>
<br />(also Chinese pheasant)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: Male 33&Prime;-36&Prime;; female 20&Prime;. <i>Male</i>: A rich chestnut-brown
bird with a conspicuous <i>white collar</i> at the base of a dark green neck, and an
extremely long pointed tail. Hybridizes freely with the Japanese blue pheasant,
producing various combinations of ring-necked and blue plumage. <i>Female</i>:
Dull brown with a shorter tail than the male, similar to the Japanese blue hen.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Ring-necked pheasant cock</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced from China about 1865, now widely
distributed on all main islands. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Pure ring-necks are quite rare but
Japanese blue hybrids are not uncommon in grassy openings, especially along
the Mauna Loa Strip road. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;One of the most common birds of
the park, both inside and out of the crater.</p>
<p>VOICE: The cocks crow throughout the breeding season (January-July) with
a violent staccato <i>koor-k&aacute;ck</i>.</p>
<p class="tb">Optimum pheasant habitat is large open grassy areas interspersed with
brush cover, and since this condition prevails on the slopes of Haleakala and
along the Mauna Loa Strip road, these birds are found in both sections of
the park. Your first view of one will likely be when it flushes out with a great
flurry of wingbeats alongside a road or trail in these grasslands. Family
broods with as many as 10 chicks may be seen from April through August.</p>
<h3>JAPANESE BLUE PHEASANT <i>Phasianus colchicus versicolor</i>
<br />(also versicolor or green pheasant)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: Male about 27&Prime;, female 20&Prime;. <i>Male</i>: Has a blue-green back,
iridescent green or purple breast, and long tail feathers. Appears darker than
the ring-necked pheasant and lacks the white collar. <i>Female</i>: Brownish birds
with long tails, indistinguishable from the ring-necked hen.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced from Japan prior to 1900. Has lost its
identity on most islands due to hybridization with the ring-neck. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;The
park includes perhaps the best habitat in the islands for this species.
Pure Japanese blue males are common along the Mauna Loa Strip road and
occasional on the Chain of Craters road or the Crater Rim drive and to the
west. Hybrids will also be seen. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Nearly all are ring-necked
pheasants here.</p>
<p>VOICE: The cock-crow is similar to that of the ring-neck, but somewhat
higher in pitch.</p>
<p class="tb">This species has adapted to the moist open-forest and grassland, while the
ring-neck prefers drier areas. Blues seem to have established a niche on the
southern slopes of Mauna Loa between 4,000 and 7,000 feet elevation where
mists are frequent, sometimes for days at a time.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>American golden plover in winter plumage</i></p>
</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c12">AMERICAN GOLDEN PLOVER <i>Pluvialis dominica</i>
<br />(Hawaiian name&mdash;kolea)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 10&Prime;-11&Prime;. A medium sized shore bird with a straight, inch-long
bill. <i>Winter plumage</i>&mdash;mottled brown spotted with gold; buffy breast.
<i>Summer plumage</i>&mdash;striking pattern; back spotted with gold, black undersides,
and a white band over the forehead and down the sides of the neck and breast.
Plovers don their summer colors in April or May before migration and may
still retain them when they return in early August. The only shore bird likely
to be seen in the interior of either park.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Winter migrant to the islands. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Fairly
common locally from August to June. To be seen around Park Headquarters
and on the west side of Kilauea Crater or along the Mauna Loa Strip.
<b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Common from August to June in open areas both inside and
out of the crater.</p>
<p>VOICE: A clear whistle <i>queep</i>, or <i>quee-le&eacute;p</i>, etc., usually uttered as the bird
is flushed.</p>
<p class="tb">Like other migrants to Hawaii, golden plovers make a 2,000-mile (one
way) flight to and from their breeding grounds in Alaska or Siberia each
year. The trip requires about 48 hours, spent mostly over the open ocean.
When they arrive in Hawaii in the fall, individuals seem to establish remarkably
small territories&mdash;one bird may live during its entire stay here in an
area not much bigger than a large lawn. Here they will feed on insects and
berries until it is time for the annual migration to the north.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h3>RUDDY TURNSTONE <i>Arenaria interpres</i>
<br />(Hawaiian name&mdash;akekeke)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 9&Prime;. A chunky, medium sized shore bird with flashy black,
white, and russet-red markings and short orange legs. The contrasty black
and white pattern shows best in flight.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Winter migrant to islands. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Except for
summer, when they have migrated to Alaska, flocks are often found at rocky
beach areas around Halape, but they are uncommon elsewhere along the
rugged coast within park boundaries. Large flocks were formerly recorded
inland as far as Kilauea Crater. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Absent from the park.</p>
<p>VOICE: A rapidly repeated <i>chut-a-chut</i>.</p>
<p class="tb">A flock of 8 or 10 turnstones will behave almost as though it was controlled
by one mind: in flight they dip and turn precisely together; when they land
it is a simultaneous action. The name turnstone comes from their habit of
flipping over small rocks with their bills to get at the insects and other lower
forms of life beneath.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c13">WANDERING TATTLER <i>Heteroscelus incanum</i>
<br />(Hawaiian name&mdash;ulili)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 11&Prime;. A large sandpiper with <i>uniformly dark gray</i> upper
parts and a long (1&frac12; inches) straight bill. The belly is lighter, and there
is an indistinct white line over the eye. The long legs and the feet are yellow.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Winter migrant to islands. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Uncommon
along the southern rocky shoreline. Absent in summer when it migrates to
Alaska. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Absent from the park.</p>
<p>VOICE: A high clear <i>whee-we-we-we</i> usually uttered as the bird takes flight.</p>
<p class="tb">Individuals feed on crabs and other marine life among the rocks. They
never appear inland in the park.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c14">WHITE-CAPPED NODDY <i>Ano&uuml;s tenuirostris</i>
<br />(Hawaiian name&mdash;noio)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 14&Prime;. A dark gray tern restricted to the rocky coastline.
The forehead and crown are lighter gray than the rest of the body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: The only common bird to be seen flying just off
shore. In the park, restricted to the coastline of the Kilauea Section.</p>
<p class="tb">Look for these along the ocean at the Kalapana end of the park. They
flutter over the water picking up small fish, but usually they stay close to
shore. The noddies nest in sea cliffs and caves in this area.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c15">SPOTTED DOVE <i>Streptopelia chinensis</i>
<br />(also laceneck or Chinese dove)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 12&Prime;. A gray-brown dove with a long rounded tail showing
white in the corners, and a broad <i>collar of black with white spots</i> on the neck.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced before 1900; now common below 4,000
feet on all islands. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Fairly common around the crater and at lower
elevations such as on the Chain of Craters and Hilina Pali roads. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Absent
from the park.</p>
<p>VOICE: Typical dove-like coos; often <i>coo-co&oacute;-coo</i>.</p>
<p class="tb">Like the barred dove, this species does not much penetrate the native rain
forest, but rather seems restricted to areas where man has altered the vegetation.
Both species feed on seeds and some fruit.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="574" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Spotted dove&mdash;Barred dove</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h3>BARRED DOVE <i>Geopelia striata</i></h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 8&Prime;-9&Prime;. Much smaller than the spotted dove and lacks the
lacy white neck. Has white outer tail feathers.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced to the islands in 1922; still spreading
on the island of Hawaii since its arrival here in 1935 from Asia. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Rare&mdash;at
elevations below 3,000 feet. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Absent from the park.</p>
<p>VOICE: A rapid ringing phrase, higher pitched and faster than for the
spotted dove, often <i>whee&eacute;dle-de-wer</i>.</p>
<p class="tb">The range for this dove on Hawaii is continuing to increase. It is now
abundant along the Kona coast and has spread in both directions around the
island. Look for it within the park on the Hilina Pali road or on the Kalapana
road.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c16">PUEO <i>Asio flammeus</i>
<br />(also Hawaiian short-eared owl)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 14&Prime;-15&Prime;. A medium-sized owl of buffy brown color and
with small ear tufts. In flight it appears big-headed and neckless compared
to the io.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Occasional around the crater and in
grassy areas on the Mauna Loa Strip. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Occasional near meadows
inside the crater such as at Paliku; also on the lower slopes, especially
just below Park Headquarters. They are frequently seen on the drive up to
the park.</p>
<p>VOICE: Rarely heard muffled barking sounds.</p>
<p class="tb">You may be surprised to see an owl soaring hawklike over grassy openings
in full daylight. However, this Hawaiian race of the mainland short-eared
owl is often diurnal. It will hover over one spot until a mouse or rat ventures
out into the open, then with a swoop the pueo captures its meal.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c17">SKYLARK <i>Alauda arvensis</i></h3>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/bskylark.jpg" alt="" width="730" height="502" />
<p class="pcap">SKYLARK</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 7&Prime;. A nondescript buffy, streaked bird with
<i>white outer tail feathers</i> found only in open country. The head may appear
crested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced early to most of the islands. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Fairly
common in open grassy places, for example on the floor of Kilauea
Crater or along the Mauna Loa Strip. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Fairly common both
inside and out of the crater.</p>
<p>VOICE: Look to the sky when you hear an exceedingly long, high-pitched
rolling song. The skylark sings while on the wing and its beautiful music
may last for a minute or longer.</p>
<p class="tb">Certainly the most remarkable thing about this bird is its song&mdash;which
it delivers while hovering sometimes hundreds of feet in the air. Just when
you think that the lofty music must end, a skylark will change to a new series
of phrases and keep this up for another minute or so. Skylarks feed and nest
on the ground. Nests attributed to skylarks made entirely of &ldquo;Pele&rsquo;s hair&rdquo;
have been found in the Kilauea area. &ldquo;Pele&rsquo;s hair&rdquo; is spun volcanic glass
formed during an eruption&mdash;a strange material indeed for the construction of
a bird&rsquo;s nest.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c18">CHINESE THRUSH <i>Trochalopterum canorum</i>
<br />(also spectacled thrush)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 9&Prime;. In the dense wet forests a large, reddish-brown bird
with <i>broad white &ldquo;eye spectacles&rdquo;</i> can only be this species. The white band
around each eye extends backward to the ear. You will probably hear this
bird before seeing it.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced at the turn of the century. Now on all
major islands. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Occasional in the wet ohia forest such as around
Park Headquarters. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Absent from the park.</p>
<p>VOICE: A mockingbird-like series of sustained musical and harsh notes that
carries for a great distance. The rich phrases may be repeated several times
before a new pattern is given.</p>
<p class="tb">These secretive birds seem to make a vertical migration to Kilauea from
the east each summer. They are rarely observed in the park during winter
months, but that may be due to their lack of song in the non-breeding season.
In summer you will probably hear several before seeing even one, as they are
wary and keep to the underbrush, moving about very little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h3><b id="g_RedBilledLeiothrix">RED-BILLED LEIOTHRIX</b> <i>Leiothrix lutea</i>
<br />(also Japanese hill robin or Peking nightingale)</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/bleiothrix.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="440" />
<p class="pcap">RED-BILLED LEIOTHRIX</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 5&frac12;&Prime;. One of the easiest to identify: An olive-green
bird with contrasting red and yellow markings and a <i>bright red-orange
bill</i>. The back is olive-green, throat lemon-yellow shading to red-orange in
the breast, and the wing varied with yellow, orange, crimson, and black.
Immatures are not as bright, but have the same general markings.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced to the islands from Asia mainly in the
twenties. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Very common throughout vegetated areas. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Fairly
common in areas of dense vegetation such as Paliku.</p>
<p>VOICE: No wonder these birds are sometimes called &ldquo;robins&rdquo;, for their
robinlike warbled song fills the air in spring and summer. If you approach
they will often begin their excited noisy call notes, a rapid <i>bzzt-bzzt-bzzt</i>,
etc., which will usually continue for some time as the birds nervously flit
about the underbrush. Another common note, usually heard from a distance,
is a sharp <i>wheek-wheek-wheek</i> made up of 3-8 notes.</p>
<p class="tb">The leiothrix is strictly a bird of the undergrowth and you are likely to
find it wherever there is plenty of bush cover in moist forested areas. Mamake,
a Hawaiian nettle, is one of its favorite haunts. If one bird is seen, there are
probably several others nearby, and flocks of a dozen or more are common in
fall and winter. Fruit, seeds, and insects comprise the food.</p>
<p>These birds have strange migration habits. In the fall and early winter
large flocks may suddenly appear at the summit of Haleakala where they
stay a short time and then return to lower areas. On Hawaii flocks have been
recorded at above 13,000 feet on Mauna Loa during this season, but they
are reduced by deaths caused by exposure and starvation on the barren slopes
if they do not descend soon.</p>
<p>Although today the leiothrix is one of the best loved birds on the islands,
its introduction here may have been unfortunate. It is known to be a carrier
of bird malaria, a disease that has probably contributed to the continuing
decline of native Hawaiian honeycreepers.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c19">MOCKINGBIRD <i>Mimus polyglottos</i></h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 10&Prime;-11&Prime;. A slender, gray and white bird with <i>large white
wing patches</i> and white outer tail feathers.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced since 1928 on Oahu and Maui. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Birds,
apparently migrants from Maui, were seen in the northern part of
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
the island in 1959; however, none have yet reached the park (1961). <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Occasional
on slopes below the summit; rare inside Haleakala Crater.
Probably still increasing its range within the park.</p>
<p>VOICE: The song is a brilliant series of phrases often repeated like the
Chinese thrush but more varied. One note is an emphatic <i>thack</i>.</p>
<p class="tb">You are most likely to see mockingbirds along the lower slopes of Haleakala
during your drive up to the crater. Park Headquarters is about the
upper limit for these birds on Maui. The food consists of insects, fruit, and
occasionally greens.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c20">OMAO <i>Phaeornis obscura</i>
<br />(also Hawaiian thrush)</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/bomao.jpg" alt="" width="864" height="646" />
<p class="pcap">OMAO</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 7&Prime;. Usually heard first, then seen if you are
patient, for it often remains motionless. A medium sized gray-brown thrush
with no distinct markings. Only similar species is the Chinese thrush which is
larger, more reddish brown, and has white markings around the eye.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Moderately common in the wet ohia
forest, especially along the Crater Rim Trail between Park Headquarters and
Thurston Lava Tube. Uncommon on lava flows between 7,000 and 9,200 feet
elevation&mdash;to be seen along the Mauna Loa trail. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Absent from
Maui.</p>
<p>VOICE: Any one of several buzzing notes, a medium pitched <i>e&eacute;au</i>, or <i>pruee&eacute;</i>,
or a low throaty <i>whuaa&aacute;</i> are likely to be heard before the song. These notes
may be interspersed and are often repeated many times with a few seconds
interval. The song is a rapid, erratic whistled phrase, having the loud fluty
quality of other thrushes.</p>
<p class="tb">This strange thrush lives in two contrasting habitats within Hawaii Volcanoes
National Park. In the dense forest you will usually find it singing from
its perch part way up an ohia or other tree. But there may be no trees in sight
at its other locality which is among the barren lava flows on Mauna Loa.
However, there will always be berry bushes nearby&mdash;ohelo, pukeawe, or
kukaenene; and insects also comprise a part of the diet. The lava flow birds
establish day-time roosts on the higher rocks and remain at these sites for
long periods, judging from the accumulation of droppings. Old perch sites
stand out clearly on a flow, for a yellow-green lichen colors the top of whatever
rocks have been plastered with omao droppings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="474" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Ohelo&mdash;favorite food of the omao</i></p>
</div>
<p>The nesting sites for these birds have remained an enigma until recently.
Now it is known that birds living on the flows will build their nests on ledges
within deep horizontal lava cracks, especially in collapsed lava tubes, while
the forest birds are said to nest in trees.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c21">ELEPAIO <i>Chasiempsis sandwichensis</i></h3>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/belepaio.jpg" alt="" width="523" height="480" />
<p class="pcap">ELEPAIO</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 5&frac12;&Prime;. A brownish flycatcher with variegated
black, white, and gray markings. The dark bill is short (&frac12; inch) and nearly
straight. The female has less black on the breast and throat, while immatures,
generally more brown, have a reddish instead of a white ruff around the vent.
Its friendly wrenlike actions combined with the above make it unmistakable.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Common in the more heavily vegetated
areas around Kilauea Crater and to the east. Look for it at Kipuka Puaulu.
<b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Absent from Maui.</p>
<p>VOICE: A variety of short songs or calls. One is like a &ldquo;wolf whistle&rdquo;, a
clear <i>whe&eacute;-oo</i> (or <i>elepa&iacute;-o</i>). Another is a nasal <i>ye&eacute;kik</i>. A single <i>wheek</i> as
well as short nasal chirps are also common.</p>
<p class="tb">The elepaio is probably the friendliest of our native birds. It is easily
overlooked, since it usually remains fairly quiet when you first approach, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
if you pause for a few moments in the wet fern jungle, one or more of these
birds are likely to appear. They seem very inquisitive as they hop about in
the low underbrush, often within a few feet of an observer, and they cock
their tails high whenever they alight. Like the omao these birds often push
their wings forward with a rapid shivering motion when confronted by people,
probably a type of aggressive action.</p>
<p>Being a member of the Old World flycatcher family, the elepaio is adapted
to an insect diet which it gleans from the tree tops to the ground, but mostly
in the understory. It often feeds like a creeper, carefully working up or
down the trunk of an ohia in search of insect life. There seem to be no
seasonal movements; individuals or family groups of two to four birds apparently
remain in the same general area throughout the year.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c22">MYNAH <i>Acridotheres tristis</i></h3>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/bmynah.jpg" alt="" width="909" height="667" />
<p class="pcap">MYNAH</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 9&Prime;. No other bird like it. Black, brown, and
white with yellow bill, feet, and skin around the eye; above all noisy. Large
white wing patches are conspicuous in flight.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced from India in 1865. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Common
at Park Headquarters, around other human habitations, and to the south
especially around Hilina Pali. Occasional in the Kau Desert. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;A
few live around the Park Headquarters area in the summer months but they
descend to lower elevations in winter.</p>
<p>VOICE: A raucous mixture of squawks, mews, and chirrs not likely to be
mistaken for any other bird.</p>
<p class="tb">For a bird that prefers to live around human habitations, the mynah is
extremely wary of people&mdash;probably with good reason, for among the imported
birds the mynah has never been particularly well loved. Yet it is at least partly
beneficial since it often feeds on agricultural insect pests. &ldquo;Mynah bird&rdquo; has
become a favorite Hawaiian expression for anyone who chatters endlessly.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c23">WHITE-EYE <i>Zosterops palpibrosus</i>
<br />(also mejiro)</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/bwhiteeye.jpg" alt="" width="472" height="360" />
<p class="pcap">WHITE-EYE</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 4&frac12;&Prime;. A tiny yellow-green bird with a distinct
<i>white eye-ring</i>. Its back and wings are green, the throat yellow, and under
parts gray; the bill is thin and straight. Only other common small green
bird is the amakihi, which has no white around the eyes. Immatures are duller,
and the eye-ring, although present, is less distinct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced from Japan in 1929. Now widely established
on all islands. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Common almost everywhere in the park.
<b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Fairly common throughout the park, except at the highest elevations
or in the barren portions of the crater.</p>
<p>VOICE: A thin, high-pitched song a bit like that of the house finch, but much
higher and not as loud. Note: a high <i>tsee</i> or <i>chee</i> given repeatedly.</p>
<p class="tb">You will hear a rapid chittering of high notes as a flock of three or four
white-eyes fly into the nearby shrubbery. Notice how quickly they work over
the foliage and limbs gleaning tiny insects. They continue to utter their notes
as they feed, but soon one by one they are off again to new vegetation.</p>
<p>The pattern of population increase for the white-eye has paralleled that
of many exotic species. Following their introduction in 1929 the birds were
at first slow to increase their range, but in more recent years a population
explosion has taken place ... on the Island of Hawaii, at least. It is presently
the commonest bird on the island and it seems to have adapted to nearly every
habitat. There is every indication that the white-eye, competing for insects
with native Hawaiian birds such as the Hawaiian creeper, has virtually eliminated
some of the natives from their former habitat.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c24">AMAKIHI <i>Loxops virens</i></h3>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/bamakihi.jpg" alt="" width="523" height="400" />
<p class="pcap">AMAKIHI<br />(male)</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 4&frac12;&Prime;. Yellow-green with no outstanding markings,
and a dark slightly downcurved bill. The male is bright green above with
a yellowish breast, while the female and immatures are duller, tending toward
gray-green. It is a real problem to distinguish between a female or young
amakihi and the very rare Hawaiian creeper (next bird).</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Very common on the slopes of Mauna
Loa around tree-line (for example along the Mauna Loa trail); less common
in the wet ohia forests around Kilauea Crater and along the Chain of Craters
road. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Common in the open forests such as Hosmer Grove and
Paliku.</p>
<p>VOICE: The usual song, a slow tinkling trill, <i>tink-tink-tink-tink-tink-tink-tink</i>
or <i>wheedle-wheedle-wheedle</i>, etc., is uttered by the male. Commonest foraging
note (both sexes) is a high <i>djeee</i>; another note is <i>wheee</i> with a rising inflection.</p>
<p class="tb">You will see a little green bird flit into a mamani or other nearby tree and
begin to seek insects among the foliage, visiting the blossoms for nectar if the
tree happens to be in bloom. You hear a buzzy <i>djeee</i> and you have made
acquaintance with the amakihi. This Hawaiian honeycreeper prefers more
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
open forest than do the other two common members of the family, the apapane
and iiwi. But often all three are found together, with the amakihis working
through the entire foliage and not just in the tree tops.</p>
<p>Seasonal movements are much less obvious than for either apapanes or
iiwis, probably because amakihis are less dependent on flowering periods.
However, some migration does occur, especially in and out of their lower range
below 3,000 feet elevation. Nesting is in late spring and early summer.</p>
<h3>HAWAIIAN CREEPER <i>Loxops maculata</i></h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 4&frac12;&Prime;. Very similar to the female or immature amakihi, but
the bill is straighter and tends to be lighter in color. Creepers search for
insects on the trunks and heavier branches, while amakihis usually work more
in the foliage.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Now very rare in the upper rain forest
or koa parkland on Mauna Loa. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Has not been definitely recorded
within the park for many years.</p>
<p class="tb">Twenty years ago creepers were often seen in the Mauna Loa Strip area
of the Kilauea Section, but from 1958-1960 the author saw only one. On the
other hand, introduced white-eyes have greatly increased their numbers in
recent years, and now they are by far the commonest bird along the Mauna
Loa Strip. White-eyes feed in much the same manner as creepers&mdash;they carefully
glean tiny insects from limbs of ohia, mamani, and other trees. It seems
likely that direct competition for insects by the white-eyes is an important
factor in the recent decline of Hawaiian creepers.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: 6&frac12;&Prime;. A greenish bird with a heavy <i>parrotlike
bill</i>. Male: Varying shades of green above, lighter below, with a <i>bright yellow
head</i> that give it the appearance of being unusually large headed. <i>Female and
Immature</i>: Lack the yellow head.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Rare; in the wet tree-fern jungle. Thurston
Lava Tube is within its range. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Absent from Maui.</p>
<p>VOICE: A beautiful singer, according to Munro. Note: a medium high-pitched
<i>tewe&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p class="tb">Ous are fairly inactive birds, often spending long periods quietly on the
branch of an ohia or other tree, and would be difficult to locate in the dense
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
forest except for the bright male plumage. They frequently travel in pairs and
apparently have a small individual range, for the same pair may be seen day
after day in one locality. Their food consists of fruit.</p>
<h3><b id="g_Apapane">APAPANE</b> <i>Himatione sanguinea</i></h3>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/bapapane.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="534" />
<p class="pcap">APAPANE<br />(immature and adult)</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 5&frac12;&Prime;. Crimson red with black wings and tail,
<i>white abdomen</i>, and slightly down-curved <i>black bill</i>. Only similar species, the
iiwi, has a red abdomen and a long orange bill. Immatures are confusing, as
the red is mostly lacking. However, grayish birds having a touch of rusty
red on the sides and white under the tail, and feeding in ohia tops, are surely
this species. The throat and face of young apapanes may appear yellow-orange.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Common to abundant throughout the
wet ohia forest; much less common in the drier forests. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Common
locally in forested areas such as Hosmer Grove or Paliku.</p>
<p>VOICE: You will hear a constant chorus of short songs and notes from the
highest ohia tops whenever apapanes are about. The quality varies from sweet
whistled notes to harsh chips and buzzes, usually intermixed. Probably the
most varied songster in the park.</p>
<p class="tb">The apapane is likely to be your first introduction to the endemic
Hawaiian honeycreepers. While most of Hawaii&rsquo;s native birds have either
become extinct or are greatly reduced in numbers, this species seems to have
held its own wherever there are ohia trees to provide a supply of lehua nectar.
Examine a cluster of red ohia blossoms. You will find that each tiny cup
which bears long bright stamens is filled with honey. A single ohia in full
bloom with countless thousands of these nectar-cups must produce many
pounds of honey. No wonder one blossoming tree will attract so many
honeycreepers.</p>
<p>You will see the birds high in the trees, flitting about from flower to flower,
often stopping to pick up insects along the way. Although a few trees are
in bloom throughout the year in any given area, there are definite &ldquo;flowering
periods&rdquo; for the ohia when more than half of the trees may be in full
blossom. The season for these flowering periods will vary among localities,
and tremendous flocks of apapanes and other honeycreepers follow the bloom
from one area to another. They can often be seen flying high overhead in
small groups, all going in the same direction. But even during times when the
ohias are out of bloom a few apapanes will remain in the forest.</p>
<p>The breeding season is an extended one, and you may see immature
apapanes with almost no sign of red plumage from February to October.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/biiwi.jpg" alt="" width="621" height="439" />
<p class="pcap">IIWI</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 5&frac34;&Prime;. A brilliant scarlet body and <i>long, orange,
sickle-shaped bill</i> distinguishes this honeycreeper. Lacks the white abdomen
of the apapane. Immatures appear greenish-yellow with patches of red
developing with age, but the long orange bill is always diagnostic.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Common in the wet ohia forest, especially
when the trees are in bloom. Kipuka Puaulu and the vicinity of Thurston
Lava Tube are likely places. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Fairly common in Hosmer
Grove and the forest behind Paliku.</p>
<p>VOICE: The creaking of a rusty gate, <i>ker-ee&eacute;k</i> is the best description for its
commonest note. Other calls include a sharp whistle and a short warble, all
rather harsh.</p>
<p class="tb">Look for this bright Hawaiian honeycreeper among flocks of apapanes
in the forest. On a calm day you will hear the heavy flutter of their wings
as they fly from tree to tree. Apapanes also have a similar feather structure
which produces such noisy flight.</p>
<p>Iiwis tend to feed more in the upper-middle branches rather than the
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
high tops, and they seem to remain in a single tree for a longer time than the
apapanes. Their food is made up of nectar (ohia, mamane, and other flowers)
which they suck up through tubular tongues that extend the length of their
sickle bills, and the larger insects. Old koa trees often attract iiwis, presumably
because of the insects.</p>
<p>You will see birds in green juvenile plumage any time from February
until autumn. These young birds seem to be especially affected by bird lice, for
they spend much time scratching and preening.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c25">RICEBIRD <i>Munia nisoria</i></h3>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/bricebird.jpg" alt="" width="429" height="356" />
<p class="pcap">RICEBIRD</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 4&Prime;. A tiny, <i>dark-faced</i> bird with a heavy blackish
bill. Differs from house sparrow and house finch females in its smaller
size, the dark face and throat, and under parts that look speckled. The flanks
may appear barred. Nearly always in flocks.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced to the islands about 1865. Now established
on all main islands. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Occasional to common along most park
roads except in the Kau Desert and the upper Mauna Loa Strip. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Absent
from the park.</p>
<p>VOICE: A short <i>wheek</i> or <i>whire&eacute;p</i>, softer than the chip of the house finch,
and usually repeated.</p>
<p class="tb">Ricebirds used to be great pests among the rice fields of lower elevations,
but their numbers have diminished now that little rice is grown on the islands.
Notice the flocks of half-a-dozen or so that fly out with short wing beats along
park roads, trails, or other places where weeds thrive. They are primarily
ground feeders and even in flight they seldom rise much above the ground
surface.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c26">HOUSE SPARROW <i>Passer domesticus</i>
<br />(also English sparrow)</h3>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 6&Prime;. Almost everyone knows this chunky, grayish-brown
bird with a heavy bill, restricted to areas of human habitation. Males have
black throats; females gray.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced before 1870. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Restricted to
areas of human habitations. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;A few around Park Headquarters,
mainly during the summer months.</p>
<p>VOICE: Dull chirps.</p>

<h3><b id="g_Cardinal">CARDINAL</b> <i>Richmondena cardinalis</i></h3>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/bcardinal.jpg" alt="" width="1093" height="855" />
<p class="pcap">CARDINAL<br />(female and male)</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 4&Prime;-10&Prime;. <i>Male</i>&mdash;the only <i>all red bird with a
crest</i>. <i>Female</i>&mdash;yellowish-brown with some red, also crested. Both sexes
have a heavy red bill: however, immatures, which resembles females, have
dark beaks.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced on several islands since 1929. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;Fairly
common locally in the drier vegetated areas such as Kipuka Puaulu.
<b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;Absent from the park.</p>
<p>VOICE: The song, which may be varied, is made up of a liquid whistled
phrase usually repeated. Note: a sharp <i>tik</i>.</p>
<p class="tb">Visitors from the eastern states will recognize familiar birdcalls when a
cardinal is nearby. They are usually rather shy birds here, so you will
probably hear them first. Seeds, insects, and fruit make up the diet of these
birds. They are often found in company with the red-billed leiothrix.</p>
<h3><b id="g_HouseFinch">HOUSE FINCH</b> <i>Carpodacus mexicanus</i>
<br />(also linnet or papaya bird)</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/bfinch.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="525" />
<p class="pcap">HOUSE FINCH<br />(female and male)</p>
</div>
<p>DESCRIPTION: 5&frac12;&Prime;. <i>Male</i>&mdash;Grayish-brown with rosy red
breast, forehead, stripe over eye, and rump. At Haleakala the color is more
yellow than red. <i>Female</i> and <i>Immature</i>&mdash;Sparrowlike with a gray-brown
back and dusky-white streaked breast. House finches have thick seed-eating
bills.</p>
<p>PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced before 1870. <b>Kilauea</b>&mdash;very common
in the drier sections of the park, especially along the Hilina Pali road and at
Kipuka Puaulu. <b>Haleakala</b>&mdash;One of the commonest birds in the park both
inside and out of the crater.</p>
<p>VOICE: A rapid, disjointed warbling song, usually lasting several seconds.
Note: one or a series of chirps, more musical than that of the house sparrow.</p>
<p class="tb">This is strictly a social species living in flocks ranging in size from a
few birds to 20 or more. On the Island of Hawaii the introduced house finch
has adapted well to a habitat that is presently unoccupied by any native
resident&mdash;the dry grassy regions of the Kau Desert and along Hilina Pali.</p>
<p>On the mainland house finches are reddish; the same is true for most
Kilauea birds. However, at Haleakala the usual color of the male is yellow
or orange. It seems likely that diet, which is known to affect pigmentation
in bird plumage, rather than heredity, is the cause of this difference.</p>

<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">OTHER BIRDS</span></h2>
<h3><span class="sc">Accidentals</span></h3>
<p>From time to time various sea and other birds passing over the island
or blown inland during a storm may be observed in either park. In recent
years such accidentals have included:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Red-footed booby (<i>Sula sula</i>): one record, Kilauea (1959).</dt>
<dt>Peregrine falcon (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>): seen at Kilauea during 1961.</dt>
<dt>Red phalarope (<i>Phalaropus fulicarius</i>): one record, Kilauea (1949).</dt>
<dt>Gray-backed tern (<i>Sterna lunata</i>): one record, Kilauea (1959).</dt></dl>
<h3><span class="sc">Formerly Recorded</span></h3>
<p>Several native birds that were formerly found within the park have not
been recorded in recent years. They include:</p>
<p>Hawaiian crow (<i>Corvus tropicus</i>): This, the only crow here and endemic
to the Island of Hawaii, formerly occurred within the park. One recent
Kilauea record (1940).</p>
<p>Akepa (<i>Loxops coccinea</i>): A tiny (4&frac12;&Prime;) bird. <i>Male</i>: Red-orange with
no white markings. <i>Female</i>: Green above and yellow below. Still occurs in
the koa forests northeast of the Mauna Loa Strip. Last park record was over
20 years ago.</p>
<p>Akiapolaau (<i>Hemignathus wilsoni</i>): 5&frac12;&Prime;. Like the amakihi but with a
long, curved upper mandible overlapping the short straight lower bill. Used
to be a permanent resident of the koa kipukas along the Mauna Loa Strip,
but has not been observed within the park for several years.</p>
<p>Parrot-billed koa finch (<i>Pseudonestor xanthophrys</i>): 5&frac12;&Prime;. A yellowish
parrotlike bird with a heavy hooked beak that formerly occurred in Kaupo
Gap at Haleakala. Last record, a few miles outside the park, was in 1950.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Status Uncertain</span></h3>
<p>Game birds are sometimes released by the State Division of Fish and Game
near the park, but they do not always become established. A recent release
(June 1960) just outside the park boundary near Headquarters at Haleakala
was the Erckel&rsquo;s Francolin (<i>Francolinus erckelii</i>). This large chickenlike
partridge can be recognized by its rusty-red crown. It is not yet known
whether the birds will reproduce and become established.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
